# wav_progression_gen
generates a series of wav files

Goal: accompany a guided puzzle adventure with sound effects for a specific sequence of actions
puzzlers must gather four keys
When first key is gathered, play lowest note of first chord softly
when second key is gathered, play 2nd lowest note of first chord softly
when third key is gathered, play 3rd lowest note of first chord softly
when fourth key is gathered, play highest note of first chord softly

after gathering all four keys, the chord will crescendo to max volume as previous items glow
as each item is incorporated into the puzzle, play next chord at max volume
after final item is incorporated, decrescendo to silence

I have created another tool that will play through these files as I click a button, this tool is only designed to generate the files
